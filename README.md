# QuadEVCharger
2023-24 Senior Design Project


As the EV(Electric Vehicle) market continues to expand, a new problem has surfaced in our local parking lots. Typically, it is common to see two to three EVSE(Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) stations available for EV owners to charge their vehicles at. With more EV owners comes the problem of an insufficient number of charge points available to accommodate their charging needs. PG&E estimates by 2030 the number of EVs on the road in California will be around 3 million. To alleviate this demand, PG&E proposes they need 1.2 million EVSEs to meet the charge point demand from EV owners. Our objective is to reduce the number of EVSEs needed by incorporating 4 charge points on a single EVSE, compared to the typical one to two port EVSEs that are in our parking lots currently, while also providing Level-2 charge to each of the four connected vehicles. Our approach involves developing algorithms to improve the charging process and maximize space utilization. Using the algorithms ensures each EV receives charge, optimizing the utilization of each charging station. Our design will be an alpha model of our Smart Quad EV Charger, and will therefore demonstrate the core functions of the charger while leaving out more minute details, such as; secure billing, weatherproofing, and external temperature ratings. These details will be solved in the beta model of our design. In the following sections to come, we look into current and past literature on our project, the methodology and risks involved, as well as the engineering and marketing requirements for our project.
